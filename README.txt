This project features 2 different predictors on different data sets (canned and uncanned). 

canned_predictor.ipynb contains the predictor on canned data taken from UCI. This predictor uses Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, and K-Nearest Neighbors from scikit-learn.
uncanned_predictor.ipynb contains the predictor on uncanned data taken from the US Census Bureau. This predictor uses self-implemented Naive Bayes.

To run, open the .ipynb files and follow directions within those files.

Data: 
- the 'data' folder contains csv files for uncanned_predictor.ipynb
- adult.data.csv is the data file for canned_predictor.ipynb

Other file:
- dictionary.py is a file used by uncanned_predictor.ipynb that maps features to their abbreviation for quick querying purposes.
